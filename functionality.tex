\section{Functionality}
Intuitively, the wallet should offer three important functions. Given a seed and the ability of network interactions, it should present the user with:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Their balance.
    \item Their transaction history.
    \item The ability to create new valid transactions, given a description.
\end{enumerate}

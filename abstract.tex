The primary function of a cryptocurrency is money transfer between individuals. The \emph{wallet} is the software that facilitates such transfers. Wallets are nowadays ubiquitous in the cryptocurrency space and a cryptocurrency is usually supported by many wallets. Despite that, the functionality of wallets has never been formally defined. Additionally, the mechanisms employed by the many wallets in the wild remain hidden in their respective codebases.

In this work we provide the first definition of a cryptocurrency wallet. We provide a distinction of wallets in various categories, based on whether they work for transparent or private cryptocurrencies, what trust assumptions they require, their performance and their communication overhead. For each type of wallet we provide a pseudocode implementation. Additionally, we explore the \emph{light wallets} and describe their difference to \emph{light clients} that have appeared in recent literature. Finally, we prove that light wallets are infeasible in private cryptocurrencies like ZCash.

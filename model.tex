\section{Our Model}
\begin{definition}
    A cryptocurrency wallet $W_\text{seed}$ is a pair of algorithms (\textsf{Sync}, \textsf{History}, \textsf{Spend}).
    
    $\mathsf{Sync}(\text{state}) \rightarrow \text{state}'$: Takes a user's cryptocurrency seed and the wallet state$'$ and produces a new wallet state' after interacting with network participants. We denote the initial state as $\varepsilon$.
    
    $\mathsf{History}(\text{state}) \rightarrow 2^\textsc{TXs}$: Returns the transaction history for the wallet seed.
    
    $\mathsf{Spend}(\text{state}, \text{txDescription}) \rightarrow \text{tx}$: Takes a transaction description txDescription and returns a valid transaction tx that spends from funds owned by the wallet's seed.
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Computational Complexity.} Computation to restore from a seed.
\paragraph{Communication Complexity.} Bandwidth to restore from a seed.
\paragraph{Privacy.} Do we disclose any private key to an external participant or server?

Intuitively, the wallet should offer three important functions. Given a seed and the ability of network interactions, it should present the user with:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Their balance.
    \item Their transaction history.
    \item The ability to create new valid transactions, given a description.
\end{enumerate}
